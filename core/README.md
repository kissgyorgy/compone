# Compone

Compone is a **Python component framework** inspired by React, that allows for
type-safe HTML generation. It is an alternative to Python template engines,
using Python objects instead of strings. This way you get Exception tracebacks
for mistyped HTML tags and attributes instead of malformed HTML!
