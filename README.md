# Compone

Compone is a component framework for Python inspired by 
React and other JavaScript frameworks.
It's essentially a string manipulation library, you can think
about it as an alternative for a Python template engine, but
instead of writing strings, you write Python objects.
Imagine being able to write type-safe HTML and getting an
Exception traceback when mistyping an HTML tag or attribute!
That's what Compone's advantage is over a template engine.
